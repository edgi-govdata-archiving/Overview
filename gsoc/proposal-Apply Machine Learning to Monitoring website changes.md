# Project Details

| Title | Description |
|--- | ---|
| **Project Title** | Apply Machine Learning to Monitoring Website Changes |
| **Project Abstract/Summary** | The project aims at detecting the changes in a website in an automated way and help analysts in monitoring the important changes efficiently. |
| **Describe the need your project fills** | The project will be helpful in detecting some major changes in government agency website. These changes can help study various important factors. Changes can be big ones (important) or small ones (unimportant). Through applying Machine Learning, one can train a ML model to just send the important changes in a website to analyst rather than sending all the changes. This will be helpful on analyst front and will save a lot of time. Surely, we will be needing to train the model first. That will require analyst help by filtering important changes from unimportant ones. Classifying the type of changes (which is already done), can also serve as a feature. |
| **Describe how this project meets this need** | One of the most important things about this project is to train the Machine Learning model. This is a classification problem, classifying what is important and what is not. Starting with multiple machine learning algorithms and carefully analyzing how good each one of them is doing (accuracy). At the beginning, voting mechanism can be deployed, to take a vote from multiple ML algorithms to classify the change as meaningful or not meaningful. Kernel functions would be an integral and core part as we would be comparing 2 snapshots of webpages. Text analysis will also be an important part for training the model. Starting with small labelled dataset, once we work out all the issues like variance, overfitting etc., the ML algorithm can be deployed to the larger dataset, to filter the meaningful changes in two versions (snapshots) of webpages with certain accuracy. |
| **Milestones/Timelines** | Week 1: Analyzing the dataset, extracting features. Week 2-4: Deploying different ML algorithms, optimizing them and carefully analyzing their performance. Week 4-6: Training the ML algorithm with the data set provided. Week 7: Working on cross validation set. Week 8-10: Deploying the ML model on testing set and review problems (if any), and finally deploy the model to the whole incoming dataset. Week 11 onwards: Working on scalability |
| **Deliverables** | A machine learning model, that will filter out the meaningful changes in labelled websites and would help in increasing analyst efficiency in monitoring and reporting on meaningful changes. The core aim of this project is scalability. |
| **Resources** | Whatever needed is provided as it is open source project. Dataset, documentation and codebase. |
| **Setup** | I have gone through much of the documentation of the concerned open source material available (web-monitoring and web-monitoring-processing codebase). I have also gone through tracking training video, which helped me a lot in understanding the challenges and problem statement better. I need to study the example dataset given more closely and start with those first, by applying the basic machine learning models on them, and then later move on to the actual labelled dataset. |
| **Ongoing involvement** | Right now, I have strong understanding of the starting challenges of the problem statement. Currently I am trying to understand example dataset and how it can help me. |

# Student Experience

| Title | Description |
|--- | ---|
| **Previous Experience** | I have worked on a NLP project, on sentiment analysis under one of my faculty at my university. I was expected to train a Machine Learning algorithm to analyze the sentiments from the given text and provide inferences from the same. I also submitted a challenge paper based on data mining in the MSR Mining challenge conference. This challenge required me to collect, clean and analyze the data and then extract inferences from the data. I have experience with Machine Learning, python libraries and R environment. |
| **Open Source Project(s) you are working on or would like to** | Currently I am not working on any open source project, but would like to work on this open source project. |
| **Teamwork** | Both of my project included one other project partner. Other than that, I have worked in several team on managing level, like working as Workshop lead for college fest, acting as a student guide in my university counselling cell, which was responsible for mentoring 20 first year grads, winning second prize in inter college hackathon with a team of 3. I also worked in a startup as backend developer with a team of 8 people. |
| **Interests** | I am very passionate about Machine Learning and expanding my knowledge in that domain. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science are my primary interests. |
| **Commitment** | Many of my interests and projects are not related to my university core coursework. I am and was always interested in learning areas of computing background and have done it mostly by learning from various sources other than university lectures as it was not in my coursework such as books, visiting faculties and online courses. I completed both of my project with my uttermost dedication. If I am provided with the opportunity, I will work on the project with my full dedication. I will be committed for a minimum of 40 hours a week through the entire project period. |

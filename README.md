# Overview of EDGI Tools

Welcome to the Government Data Archiving Github Team. This repository is an overview for people who are getting involved in the project!

## Get Involved

### Running an Event

If you are running your own event you've come to the right repo. The documentation here complements the [Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) Event Toolkit](https://envirodatagov.org/event-toolkit/).

You'll want to check out:

- Important Repositories, pinned to the top of our organization page:
  - this [overview](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview)
  - an [event workflow](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/workflow)
  - our [data harvesting tools](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/harvesting-tools)
- [Recommendations and Lessons Learned](./RECOMMENDATIONS.md) and an [Event Checklist](./CHECKLIST.md)
- [Event Tools](#event-tools)

### Development

If you'd like to help with ongoing development of these tools, great! We are still working through the best way to bring new people onto our project. For now we have:

- [Projects](#projects)
- [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Project Tracking Board](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/projects/2)
- Github issues in each repository

# Standup Meeting Protocol

EDGI hosts weekly standup meetings open for all interested in ongoing development of [our tools](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/).

## Aim

To discuss what will help development projects reach their goal and identify areas that need support. These meetings are not the place to handle the first onboarding of new contributors, that should happen prior.

## Format

Meetings last **no longer than 30 mins**, with the following agenda

| Time        | Agenda Item    |
|-------------|----------------|
| **5 mins**  | Overall updates, given on a rotating basis by project leads or EDGI Steering Committee representatives. |
| **25 mins** | Attendee updates (soft time cap of 2 minutes per speaker) |

We go around to each participant and ask:

1. Do you need any help on a task?
1. Do you have anything else to talk about?

Conversations should stay relatively focused, with longer conversations moving off-stream.

Meetings scheduled in advance by @mattprice or @dcwalk and a [zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) call link is posted in our chat. The standup is recorded and posted to our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSfzkT_Zp5N8C_QmE7CNGig), and notes taken and made available in our chat for those who could not attend.

### **Project Details**

**Project Title:**

Implementation of ML Framework to prioritize meaningful changes in Environment related websites

**Project Abstract/Summary:**

The project aims to develop and implement a machine learning framework to prioritize diffs and generate appropriate actions.

**Describe the need your project fills:**

This project aims to fulfill the following aims to priorities the webpage diffs:

1. Conversion of html diffs to a common schema for machine learning algorithms

2. Machine Learning model to accept formated diffs as input and output their priority

3. Integrate the model and other components with other EDGI components to take human analyst feedback for improving the model.

**Describe how your project meets these needs:**

A website can undergo changes at various levels, viz: its design, layout, content and interface. For this project we are concerned with changes in the content of a website. Further the content of a website can be categorized as images, text (headings, paragraphs). In this project I propose to deal with text changes in a website.

To get the most out of machine learning models, we first have a definite diff format which can be fed to ML models. Thus the first focus of my project will be to arrive at a schema for converting various diff formats to a common format.

1. Conversion of html diffs to a common schema to form the feature matrix for machine learning model

After thorough discussion, we can arrive at a feature matrix, with the best possible feature specification to train our ML model. The following can be a prospective list of features (non-exhaustive):

1. HTML Tag difference

2. Word Difference

3. Position Difference

There shall be intermediate vectors for each class of change. For example for HTML tags the following may be a priority vector (non-exhaustive):

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Tag</td>
    <td><h1></td>
    <td><h2></td>
    <td><b></td>
    <td><p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Priority</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>


These priority vectors can help us give a relative severity index to a change derived from a diff. For example, a change from <p> tag to <h1> is a more severe change as compared to a change from <b> to <h2>. There will be similar vectors for severity for different change types. These change severity vectors can then be given to a machine learning classifier to prioritize them

2. The severity vectors can then be provided to a multi-class classifier such as multinomial logistic regression or neural networks, to assign priorities to these vectors.

3. The trained models then need to output the prioritized result to other EDGI services so that high priority changes can be analysed by the experts. 

4. The model can also be deserialized, to retrain it or to update their weights to account for some wrong result. This can be done by integrating a user feedback mechanism which can override the priorities assigned by the model. Any changes to the priority vector made by an analyst can be used to retrain the model and improve its weights.

These tasks will be conducted by a framework under which all the components would work. The framework will:

Lastly the project will be motivated towards integrating the proposed framework into EDGI services.

* For the GSOC period, I will setup all the components required to understand the codebase of already existing components and to implement my proposal.

**Ongoing involvement:**

* I would say that I have had a fair amount of involvement in the project up till now.

* I have been participating in discussions on slack channel (gsoc & dev) to provide input from my side and receive insights regarding the project. I have also tried suggesting on github issue [#18](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring/issues/18). 

* I have also opened an issue ([#17](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db/issues/17)) concerning the installation instruction provided on the repo. To resolve the same issue I have opened a PR ([#18](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db/pull/18)) and I am working on it.

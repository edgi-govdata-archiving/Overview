### Project Details

**Project Title:**  

ML Category Class Testing Tool

**Project Abstract/Summary (<20 words):**  

**Describe the need your project fills:**  

A big issue with working towards the prioritization Algorithm in the website monitor is that ML generally does not take text input. Some process must take the string diffs and assign some number to them so we can use them as part of a data point. One suggestion was to sort them into (class categories)[https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/issues/28].

**Describe how your project meets this need:**  
[How does your project address that goal? How will you know you have met it?]

**Milestones/Timeline:**  
[Sketch out preliminary milestones and a timeline for the summer]

**Deliverables:**  
[Identify what EDGI will have at the end of your project]

**Resources:**  
[List any people, documentation, literature, sample data, or hardware you will need, if applicable]

**Setup:**  
[What have you done, or will you do, to get set up for this project]

**Ongoing involvement:**  
[How do you see your involvment in the project continuing]

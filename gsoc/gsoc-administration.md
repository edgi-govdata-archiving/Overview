# GSoC Administration

Planning for administration of Google Summer of Code for EDGI. We have our profile [description](gsoc-description.md), a list of [project ideas](gsoc-ideas.md), and a [template](gsoc-template.md) for submitting proposals.

Critical steps in Feb:

- Chip off `first-timer` issues in web-monitoring, guides, archivers.space, particularly around
    - PR and contributing docs
    - Getting dev environment set up
- Expand project descriptions with more concrete details
- Don't emphasize projects that rely on a single mentor-student relationship

### Process

1. Students join us on our chat, get a sense of project possibilities, technology, and project leads
2. @dcwalk helps answer questions from students to shape proposals
3. Students submit PRs to `overview/gsoc`

## Mentors

### Call for Google Summer of Code Mentors!

Google Summer of Code (#GSoC) is a program where Google supports students to work on open source coding projects for the summer. We're looking for people --no coding experience necessary--to be mentors to students this summer. You'll be the voice of the community in shaping new features, but you don't need to be a coder--we have a group of existing contributors ready to help out in that respect!

### Mentor Responsibilities

Mentors need at least **two hours per week from May-August** to help out, thought this can be spread over several days.

What does it mean to be a mentor?
- Mentors check in with a student once per week and offer some project management guidance or provide a community perspective to their projects.
- Mentors can rely on each other quite a bit for coordinating between projects, we will arrange occasional mentor calls or sessions to address any concerns, and mentors can use existing Slack channels.
- Students often need project and time management guidance more than code guidance, and also to be reminded occasionally to ask for input from the community using our communications channels (Slack and GitHub) when they get into trouble.

## Student Outreach

During application phase aim to have:
- 2 GSoC student calls before application deadline
- Direct to `#gsoc` and @dcwalk wherever possible

During the summer:
- Request weekly check-ins in addition to filing and PRs or issues:
    - One sentence summary of the week? (as an issue?)
- Request frequent committing/merging of code

## 2017-03-02 Public Lab Call Notes

- On Mentors:
    - Recruit mentors that don't identify as coders. Role as "willing and with capacity to speak for community," (get beyond the "power users")
        - Important for them to address/represent a big picture understanding to/with students
    - Not just mentors, frame as a group process. Those familiar with codebase etc... chiming in on chat, etc...
        - [Help Public Lab’s software grow by joining a supportive team](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-08-2016/help-public-lab-s-software-grow-by-joining-a-supportive-team)
        - Look at RailsGirls [Coaching and Livecoding](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching/)
        - Mentors might disappear, as coordinator preventing drop off comes down to individual reaching out to mentors
- On Projects:
    - Should not be large projects that are built in isolation for the summer
        - PL adopted a weekly cycle of merging into master
    - Critical to decompose projects!!
- GSoC Students check-ins:
    - PRs and Issues
    - One sentence summary of the week? (maybe as an issue)
    - Turn remaining TODOs into issues, at least 1 'first-timer' issues
- On Onboarding:
    - Peer-support the best resource for onboarding

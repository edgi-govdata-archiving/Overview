# Overview

Welcome to the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) Government Data Archiving technical team. We are building online tools, helping events, and creating research networks to proactively preserve, archive and track public environmental data and ensure its continued availability. We are indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. Our focus has turned to using machine learning to sift through millions of government web pages to find the most important changes as well as working with the protocols for resilient, sustainable, distributed data storage networks. This repository is an overview for people who are getting involved in the project.

Our GitHub organization, chat, and in-person events have a [Code of Conduct](/CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Projects

The EDGI technical team is currently supporting the following projects:

| 100 days | Archiving | Data Together | Web Monitoring | Website |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |

&nbsp;<br />

We have a technical [**Roadmap**](/ROADMAP.md) organized in planning cycles and we use a [Kanban Board](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/projects/2) to work toward those milestones. In addition, each project covers specific tasks, issues, and milestones in individual repositories.

### Archiving

| Tool Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [**Nomination Tool**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/eot-nomination-tool) | Chrome extension to simplify the nomination process at archiv-a-thons | **Working** |
| [**Technical Guides**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/guides) | Technical guides for how to preserve and hold data | **Working** |


### Website Monitoring

These repositories support the current workflow, based on Google spreadsheets automatically generated from scraping the Verionista web interface. They will be deprecated when a web app-based workflow is ready to use:

| Tool Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [**web-monitoring-versionista-scraper**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-versionista-scraper) | Node.js scraper for Versionista data (faster and more reliable replacement for *Versionista Outputter* above). Note this is also used in the new web app-based workflow below.  | **Working** |
| [**Versionista Outputter**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/versionista-outputter) | A Ruby script that scrapes Versionista's web interface to generate a csv summarizing which websites and pages have had recent changes | **Archived** |
| [**Version Tracking UI**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/version-tracking-ui) | Tools to facilitate the tracking website changes | **Archived** |

These repositories will support a future workflow that improves upon the current one by:
* replacing the Google spreadsheets with a custom web app
* drawing on data from multiple sources including Versionista, PageFreezer, and others in the future
* applying text processing techniques to prioritize and filter diffs before presenting them to human volunteers

| Tool Name | Description | Status | Language |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| [**web-monitoring**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring) | Documentation and project management repo for Website Monitoring project | **Working** | `--` |
| [**web-monitoring-processing**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing) | Queries data sources, performs prioritization/filtering, populates databases for web app| **In Progress** | Python |
| [**web-monitoring-db**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db) | The Rails backend of the web app that human volunteers will use to evaluate diffs | **In Progress** | Ruby on Rails |
| [**web-monitoring-ui**](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui) | The JS front-end that human volunteers will use to evaluate diffs | **In Progress** | TypeScript |

### Other Projects...

- [EDGI website](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/edgi-website) coordination
- [Data analysis](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/analysis) scripts and tools for understanding our archiving impact
- Toolkit/remote contribution process improvements
- Redundant, distributed storage (IPFS)

## Working Openly

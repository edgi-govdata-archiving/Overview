# EDGI Data Preservation and Tool Development Working Group Update -- Mar. 06

The **Internet Archive (IA) End of Term harvest ended on March 1** and we sent our final batch of URLS nominated from the Chrome extension before then. **Six events** occured this past weekend. While they still relied upon spreadsheet-based seeding that will be submitted to the IA, we do not expect they will be included in the End of Term collection. We are working toward a different submission mechanism to IA in the coming week. Otherwise we've been working on **ongoing documentation and tools improvement** as well as **developing processes for new contributors**, including Google Summer of Codee students who start in May.

## Important Decision Points

- **Brendan** finishing proposal ofr v.2 of his app, which will allow individual contributions (not just event-based) and also move to IPFS as final disposition of datasets (not, or not just, CKAN). This will have implications for the direction of our work going forward.
- To sustain a Data Justivce movement, we need to build a list of event participants; this seems to require co-operation with Data Rescue, and needs to happen very quickly. **HIGH PRIORITY**

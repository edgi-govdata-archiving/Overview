### Project Details

**Project Title:**  

ML Category Class Testing Tool

**Project Abstract/Summary (<20 words):**  

A tool to allow developers to quickly test the usefulness of Category Class based features in the Web Monitoring project. 

**Describe the need your project fills:**  

A big issue with working towards the prioritization Algorithm in the website monitor is that ML generally does not take text input. Some process must take the string diffs and assign some number to them so we can use them as part of a data point. One suggestion was to sort them into [class categories](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/issues/28), and use the frequency of these being added and deleted. However, what words these categories should include and how they should be scored is up in the air. My proposal, while not in itself set out to address this problem, does set out to make this problem much faster and easier to address. 

**Describe how your project meets this need:**  
  
  My proposal will help create an environment where once the training and testing data becomes available, any contributer can easily try to see how changes to a category class will affect the overall algorithm. By creating a format that is easy to write and test, more contributors from different areas of expertise can help in the continuing progress of the web monitoring project.

### Project Details

**Project Title:**  
Data Visualization of Archived Content

**Project Abstract/Summary (<20 words):**  
The purpose of this project is to develop a set of visually impactful and meaningful models that allow users to easily visualize the changes archived by EDGI.

**Describe the need your project fills:**  
The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) challenges an administration who have made it a proactive effort to shut down or dilute key federal agencies responsible for the protection of the environment. You guys do this by working with a network of individuals to proactively archive and monitor all public environmental data so that it will be available in the future to the public.

This data, while vital for the community as a whole, is useless in the hands of the average individual. To put it in simple terms, the average laymen just doesn’t have the time or the enormous effort required to sit through each changing variable and try to decipher which of it is relatively “meaningful.” Most individuals looking to do research/reports in these areas, although happy to discover the archived data, will be dissuaded due to the enormous task at hand of sifting through each minor change. 

**Describe how your project meets this need:**  
This is where my project comes in. Using data visualization libraries (such as https://d3js.org/), my project’s goal will be to develop a set of models/graphs accurately displaying any “meaningful” data you have archived. I would ideally be using the DataRefuge API for this project as a means to gather data for my in-browser model, but could eventually directly integrate with your toolkit to make API calls. These visualizations, once fully completed and optimized, could be directly integrated on top of your React.js app view layer (https://www.archivers.space/). Working with my assigned mentors, I would identify how the archived data is “relevant” and then construct an appropriate model to display it. This would help individuals gain a better understanding of the data being collected when visiting the integrated model on your app. This would be a preferential solution, as opposed to sifting through tons of lists.

**Milestones/Timeline:**  
This project is essentially composed of 3 major milestones: working with my mentors to identify which data is meaningful and worth developing a model for, developing/committing the model while simultaneously receiving feedback on improvements, and then eventually documenting my process as well as what I learned for the greater community. While not explicitly stated, the general development process for this project would involve fully completing one model before moving on to the next one. Below you will find a rough timeline:

* **Before May 30th**
Familiarize myself with the current codebase of the app, any relevant API’s that DataRefuge provides, as well as, set up my environment to run local versions of your tools/apps. I will also work with my mentor to make sure that I have full understanding of the codebase as well as overall goals.

* **May 30th - June 13th**
I will spend this time working on communicating with my mentor in order to understand the current toolkit in how it captures data as well as trying to identify which of the data is relevant from both EDGI and DataRefuge.

* **Jun 13th - Jun 27th**
Once I have identified relevant data, I will start working on potential design mockups for how this information could be displayed. I will also be continuously communicating with any relevant teams to gain feedback on my designs and improve them.

* **Jun 27th - Jul 11th**
Once I have finalized a set of designs for models that both the developers and I agree on as being the most “impactful” to individuals, I will start working on prototypes for these designs and be continuously committing to production. I will also communicate, at the same time, directly with the team responsible for developing tools that archive this data so that they can potentially develop a set of API calls that I might be able to make directly to the tool instead of pulling it from a 3rd party.

* **Jul 11th -  Jul 25th**
I will have mostly completed any models at this time and will submit it to my mentors for review. If any changes need to be made, I will work on them as well! I will then starting working with my mentors to properly integrate D3 and any other visualization libraries into React while still keeping my original code intact. Most of my time this period will be spent communicating with the team and listening to any feedback they have.

* **Jul 25th - Aug 8th**
Finalize any ideas I had and submit my set of models. I will also start working on a write up about my overall experience, design process, and what I learned throughout this entire experience.

* **Aug 8th - Aug 22nd**
Reach out to individuals using the website as well as my mentors to see if I can identify any other changes to further optimize the experience and make it more interactive and meaningful on the end-user. As with any product being shipped, testing usage and interaction with the product is important to gauge its overall perception.

* **Aug 22nd - End Of Program**
Final communication with mentors and hopefully continue to work and further develop/refine models in the future with EDGI.


**Deliverables:**  
A set of models/graphs for visualization archived data (I say a set instead of a specific number, because I am not too sure going in what data we would want to display. Realistically I would like to work on from anywhere between 3 to 5 models). I would also take some time at the end completing a write-up of what I learned from my experience working on this project as well as how other people have benefited from it. 

**Resources:**  
Other than the occasional google search for help or turning to my mentors for advice, I won’t need much else.

**Setup:**  
I will be using the NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) environment setup locally on my Windows machine so that I can fork a copy of the React.JS app and run it live.

**Ongoing involvement:**  
Other than continued support for the models I have developed as well as adapting them to changing data, I will work with EDGI to identify any future needs they might have with development.

### Student Experience

**Previous Experience:**
In regards to my previous experiences, you can find more information on my resume here: http://harshbaid.com/resume.pdf

With specific to this project, I have a ton of experience with Javascript. It was one of the first few languages I learned, and as of currently, I’m comfortable with both front-end and back-end JS development. I have experience with node as well as AngularJS and Ember (other JS MVC-based frameworks similiar to React).

**Open Source Project(s) you are working on or would like to:**
Currently, I’m not involved with any public open-source project, but would eventually like to work with the Docker team in development of docker. That’s a long way down the line though.

**Teamwork:**
In regards to teamwork experience, I was the head programmer in my high school robotics team and during competition season I worked with other programmers to properly delegate tasks and come up with a timeline for delivering code. It involved a lot of management, but also a lot of time making sure that everyone on the team agreed with the coding-style guidelines I put forward. 

**Interests:**
Specific to the field of Computer Science, while I have a lot of experience with full-stack development, I’ve recently been more interested in getting involved with low-level architecture (such as embedded systems and signal processing). Outside of CS, I love reading, playing my ukulele, chess, and of course getting a good night’s sleep!

**Commitment:**
In regards to commitment, I will try to dedicate about 30 hours of my week focused on this task. I have no other commitments for this summer so far, nor any vacation plans. I will be able to fully focus on this project.

### Thank you for taking the time to reading my proposal and I hope you will consider me for GSoC 2017!

### Project Details

**Project Title:**  

Efficient Data Storage using Geo-temporal Clustering

**Project Abstract/Summary:**  

Clustering the web pages (data) based on Geographical location and time in order to facilitate Machine Learning analysis.

**Describe the need your project fills:**  

_Broader Goal_ :- Better data management and a step towards creating Environment Data Warehouse

The project will fulfill the following needs - 

_Speed, Accuracy, Objectivity(Contextualize), Performance, Scalability_

**Describe how your project meets this need:**  
1. **Speed** - Due to clustering of data, query execution time reduces dramatically, helping increase processing speed.
2. **Accuracy** - By partitioning the data into seperate containers, possiblity of accessing anomalous, incorrect data will be greatly reduced.
3. **Objectivity** - Performing division based on Time and location brings objectivity into the picture. By objectivity I mean, the change belongs to which region and during which time span. By quantifying these 2 major components, analysis is enriched and more contextualized.
4. **Performance** - Due to re-organization and revamp, overall performance of the system would be improved.
5. **Scalability** - Being a ML based Clustering approach, given any volume/quantum of data, clustering would not be impacted.


**Milestones/Timeline:**  

1. Retrieving time, location data from pages
2. Clustering based on location
3. Clustering based on time
4. Building combined model for clustering based on both the parameters

**Deliverables:**  
+ Prototype for storing data in such a way that processing it would be quicker + efficient.
+ Framework which accepts new data and stores it according to its date, location + updates existing data.

**Resources:**  
+ **Data** - Data from heterogeneous sources from PageFreeze, 
+ **Hardware** - If possible, cloud support (Google Cloud Engine instances for running algorithm on cluster)

**Setup:**  
_Done_

+ Have handy knowledge of Clustering techniques in Python.
+ Have implemented Spark (PySPark)

_To be Done_
+ Implementing Multi-node ML clustering on Spark

**Ongoing involvement:**  

As a Python programmer and ML/DS enthusiast, I would continue going through the projects revolving around these domains. Moreover, I plan to actively write code for streamlining the process of monitoring changes to websites using NLP and AI so as to pave the way for future development.

### Student Experience

**Previous Experience:**

**_Data Science Intern at Nexchanges Technology Private Limited_**

Worked on 
+ Distributed Data Processing using Apache Spark
+ Data Extraction using Python libraries Scrapy, Beautiful Soup
+ Data Warehousing using Pachyderm - Git based version control
+ Data Visualization - HTML CSS Bootstrap + D3.js 
+ Machine Learning - Applied Kmeans, Xmeans, Text clustering (Geo-temporal clustering)

**_Research Intern at MatriCS_**
+ Data exploration of Marathons, Running races, Triathlon, etc
+ Data extraction using Python library - Scrapy

**Open Source Project(s) you are working on or would like to:**
+ Web monitoring processing project of EDGI is close to my domain experience and interests and would love to contribute to the same.
+ Apache Spark architecture is another suite of technology that I have worked with and would like to develop in the future.

**Teamwork:**

**Interests:**
- I am interested in Data Science aspect of any project - may it be Data Extraction, Visualization (UI), ML or AI.
- Apart from that, Software Development and Testing / Debugging also interest me.
- Besides computer and technology, I love playing and watching sports - especially football, cricket and swimming. I play violin and enjoy singing.

**Commitment:**

I would commit to 4 hours of work every day on Weekdays and 8 hours on week-ends towards the project.

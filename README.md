# Overview

Welcome to the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) Government Data Archiving technical team. We are building online tools, helping events, and creating research networks to proactively preserve, archive and track public environmental data and ensure its continued availability. We are indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. Our focus has turned to using machine learning to sift through millions of government web pages to find the most important changes as well as working with the protocols for resilient, sustainable, distributed data storage networks. This repository is an overview for people who are getting involved in the project.

Our GitHub organization, chat, and in-person events have a [Code of Conduct](/CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

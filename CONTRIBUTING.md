# Contributing Guidelines

We love improvements to our tools! Our process for accepting changes has a few steps:

1. If you haven't submitted anything before, and you aren't (yet!) a member of our organization, **fork and clone** the repo:

        $ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<repository-name>.git

  Organization members should clone the upsteam repo, instead of working from a personal fork:

        $ git clone git@github.com:edgi-govdata-archiving/<repository-name>.git

2. Create a **new branch** for the changes you want to work on. Choose a topic for your branch name that reflects the change:

        $ git checkout -b <branch-name>

3. **Create or modify the files** with your changes. If you want to show other people work that isn't ready to merge in, commit your changes then create a pull request (PR) with _WIP_ or _Work In Progress_ in the title.

        https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/<repository-name>/pull/new/master

4. Once your changes are ready for final review, commit your changes then modify or **create your pull request (PR)**, assign as a reviewer or ping (using "`@<username>`") a Lieutenant (someone able to merge in PRs) active on the project (all Lieutenants can be pinged via `@edgi-govdata-archiving/lieutenants`)

5. Allow others sufficient **time for review and comments** before merging. We make use of GitHub's review feature to to comment in-line one PRs when possible. There may be some fixes or adjustments you'll have to make based on feedback.

6. Once you have integrated comments, or waited for feedback, a Lieutenant should merge your changes in!

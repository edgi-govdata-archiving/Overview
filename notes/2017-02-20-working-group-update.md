## Accomplishments of the Week

- **Dawn** began a major overhaul of our documentation, in collaboration w/ DR
- **Dawn** started work on a request from SF Bay: boilerplate to help events to rapidly &ldquo;spin up&rdquo; new event-specific websites
- **Andrew, Toly, & Matt** sought support for the technical side of the web-monitoring project from a variety of parties:
    - Spoke to Google for cloud computing resources; secured $5000 in credits now, with promise of ~$20-60K in the near future e& possibility of much larger sums later.  We estimate that the middle tier ($20-60) will come close to covering the expense of the cloud computing for the next 12 months.
    - Discussed integrating our work more closely with the Internet Archive; agreed to co-ordinate our funding requests to major foundations if at all possible; agreed to rewrite the everything.gov 1-pager as a collaborative document
    - Initiated a relationship with Juan Benet, founder of Protocol Labs, who offered mentorship & guidance for technical development
    - Established contact with Chris Andt, board member of NRDC&rsquo;s 501(c)4; Chris agreed to canvas support for EDGI&rsquo;s everything.gov project w/ NRDC contacts; is aware that Rebecca has reached out seperately
- Small breakthrough WRT versionista workflow; we hope it will lead to a substantial improvement for analysts, see [versionista-outputter](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/versionista-outputter)
- Additions to download scripts in harvesting tools
- **Andrew, Toly, & Matt** Work toward a future website monitoring interface
- **Dan** with B continued to make improvements to the Archivers app used at events

## Action Items

- **Toly** will send Matt a list of all collected seeds from recent events, and Matt will forward on to Internet Archive (ETA: Tuesday)
- **Andrew, Toly, & Matt** will make a concerted effort to set goals for developers to work towards in the webstie monitoring interface
- **Andrew** will solicit advice from the web tracking team re: design ideas
- **Dawn** will continue work on the documentation refactoring, event toolkit update, community protocols, and mailing list

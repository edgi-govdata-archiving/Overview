# EDGI Data Preservation and Tool Development Working Group Update -- Mar. 13

We held the first of our GSoC chat, got lots of questions and improved our application process and documentation based on questions. Two (smaller)  DataRescue events were held, we don't have numbers on those yet. Maya coordinated a "future of events" call where the mailing list and community building proposal got buy in. Dawn coordinated a call around security concerns with the Archivers app code and we have a plan to open source it by March 17.

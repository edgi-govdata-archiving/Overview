### Project Details

**Project Title:**  

ML+NLP based Automated Change Monitoring

**Project Abstract/Summary:**  

Generating Environmental corpora, classifying change as relevant or not and prioritizing relevant ones using NLP.

**Describe the need your project fills:**  

_Broader Goal_ :- Categorizing and Prioritizing Changes / Diffs

The project will fulfill the following needs - 

1. _Curated Dataset_
2. _Classifier_
3. _Priority algorithm_

**Describe how your project meets this need:**  

Major setbacks
1. Trump Budget announced - Savings of 31% EPA (reduction in fund allocation)
2. Not a single corpus / dataset on environment can be found online
3. Absence of an algorithm to track and prioritize changes

Following needs will be met in my project :-
1. Dataset - 

After intense deliberation with analysts, subject matter experts (domain experts), we would stitch together a corpus of highly influential and important keywords in the domain of environment.

2. Classifier - 

Using ML techniques (classification algorithms), the diff (from PageFreezer,Versionista) will be categorized as to important, relevant or irrelevant ones by making use of the curated dataset.

Output of Classifier will be cross-checked with the outcomes from NLP techniques (LDA and Summarizer)

3. Priority Algorithm - 

As currently, there is no standard way of prioritizing which change is to be given precendence over the others, which change is critical and more important than others - an algorithm would be needed for the same. Such an algorithm would be on the basis of "Confidence / Trust factor" and "Rating". Taking these 2 parameters into consideration, every change will be evaluated according to the algorithm and then prioritized.
It would be a self-learning, ever-evolving process of curation.

# **Deliverables:**  
+ Comprehensive, robust environment corpus.
+ Classifier that segregates changes into different categories
+ Prioritizer that assigns priority to changes

**Resources:**  
+ **Data** - Data from heterogeneous sources from PageFreeze, etc 
+ **Hardware** - If possible, cloud support (Google Cloud Engine instances for running algorithm on cluster)

**Setup:**  

I have setup the following on my machine to meet the needs of the project - 
+ PageFreezer setup ready
+ Linting  setup ready
+ Python ML libraries - Scikit-learn, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas
+ Python NLP libraries with Anaconda - NLTK, Stanford CoreNLP, SpaCY, Gensim, TextBlob
+ Python Extraction libraries (for generating Corpus of Environment words) - Scrapy, BeautifulSoup

Moreover, from knowledge / experience point of view - 
+ Handy knowledge of Machine Learning algorithms including Classifiers and Clustering.
+ Aware of open-source contributions, licensing
+ Worked on Agile methodology


**Ongoing involvement:**  

As a Python programmer and ML/DS enthusiast, I would continue going through the projects revolving around these domains. Moreover, I plan to actively write code for streamlining the process of monitoring changes to websites using NLP and AI so as to pave the way for future development.

- Apart from that, Software Development and Testing / Debugging also interest me.
- Besides computer and technology, I love playing and watching sports - especially football, cricket and swimming. I play violin and enjoy singing.

**Commitment:**

I would commit to 4 hours of work every day on Weekdays(4*5) and 10 hours on week-ends towards the project. Moreover, being a goal-driven individual, I would obviously strive to complete the goals set for the project. Hence, I understand that at times I would have to push the no. of hours / day so as to meet the needs and timeline.

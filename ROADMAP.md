# Roadmap

This roadmap is organized by planning cycles and we use a [Kanban Board](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/projects/2) to work toward established milestones. Project-specific labels track goals:

In addition, each project covers specific tasks, issues, and milestones in individual repositories.

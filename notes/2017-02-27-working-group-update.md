# EDGI Data Preservation and Tool Development Working Group Update -- Feb. 27

## Summary

In software development, two major developments:
- Brendan is considering a major change to his "pipeline" app, which will have significant implications for the organization of future Data Rescue events. He is looking at getting the app itself to perform a large fraction of the "harvesting" actions -- that is, downloading the data automatically without requiring volunteers to do any coding. This would enable us to shift our focus away from _programmers_ and towards other kinds of skillsets in our volunteers. It will take him a while to implement this, but this technical change is an opportunity to rethink our commitment to events, and what we want to get out of them.
- Dan is leading a major effort to finally develop a real web-monitoring platform that will, when it is live, very substantially reduce the workload for analysts. In combination with newly-available cloud computing resources, this means our web monitoring project is finally gathering steam.

In other news:
- the Internet Archive's End-of-Term project comes to a close on March 1. We can continue to contribute seeds to the IA's overall crawling project, but they wil lhave a different status than they had before. This also raises questions about Data Rescue events and what we should be doing at them.

## Events, Seeds, Data Uploads

2 events since February 20:
- [Twin Cities](https://www.lib.umn.edu/about/datarescue), MN
- [Seattle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/seattle-data-rescue-event-tickets-32105338933), WA

No reports on the amount of data captured.

## Accomplishments of the Week

- **Dawn** ongoing event documentation and slack management process improvements
- **Dawn** wrote blog with Liz RE: community management and communications
- **Matt** set up a Google cloud a resources there. We will shortly have our own web indexing resources running there, yay!
- **Matt** handed over our seeds list to Jefferson Bailey, after **Toly** collated the list
- **Matt** made preliminary contact with Indiana University's high-performance computing cluster about use of hteir resources in various projects
- Team: kick-started Website Monitoring and Archivers Space development. Project Leads/points of contact identified. A lot of work by **Dan** especially spearheading a reorganization of the web-monitoring software, & co-ordinating volunteer efforts

## Action Items

- Confirm changes to workflow after Mar 1, EoT crawl ends
- **Dawn**:
    - Start IPFS testing
    - Shared pre- and post- event planning docs
    - Communication Strategizing
- **Matt:**
    - Review state of projects & issues queues, get back on top of development
    - Continue conversations w/ Jefferson B. and Indiana University
    - Contribute to funding requests where appropriate, follow up on a couple that seem ot have stalled.
- **Andrew:**
    - Complete first draft mockups of website-monitoring software views to get feedback from WTT and user interface experts, before sending on to development team

# EDGI Archiving and Technical Working Group Update -- Apr. 28

We hosted the DataRescue TownHall on April 1 and that set a tone of reflecting, strategizing, and revisiting our Archiving and Technical Facilitation approaches. 10 events were held, with a focus on seeding and bagging. We have Rob working on Web Monitoring through the Doris Duke grant, will have 2 students joining us as part of Google Summer of Code in May, and have been focusing on understanding what we think the community of volunteers and archiving activites to look like. End of the week, and going forward we will be emphasising finishing the lingering EPA data that needs to be archived.
